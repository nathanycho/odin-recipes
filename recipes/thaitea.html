    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>Back in my junior year of high school, I started getting addicted to Thai Tea. 
        I wanted to learn how to make everything at home, so I bought a bag of the tea leaves, coconut milk, and Panang curry paste. 
        I never ended up making the curry, but I had a routine of making a batch of Thai Tea on Sunday nights, 
        and I would pack it in my thermos in the mornings and drink them during AP Chem.
    </p>
    <p>I always thought the color and transformation of the tea was fascinating. At first, 
        boiling this was tedious because it would constantly boil over, but maybe now that I'm older, 
        it'll work better this time. I'm planning on making a big batch and delivering some tea with the bread (-:

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>1 cup (80 g) Pantai Thai Tea Mix</ul>
    <ul>4 cups (960 ml) water</ul>
    <ul>3/4 cup (150 g) granulated sugar</ul>
    <ul>3/4 cup (240 ml) half and half, whole milk, or sweetened condensed milk</ul>
    <ul>ice</ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Bring water to a boil and add the thai tea mix. Add sugar and gentle stir to completely 
        dissolve the sugar. Gently boil tea for about 3 minutes. Remove from heat.

        <li>Allow tea to steep for at least 30 minutes and allow to cool.</li>
        <li>Strain the tea leaves - using reusable cloth filters. Set finished tea aside to cool.</li>
        <li>Fill glasses with ice and pour in Thai tea leaving enough room to fill your creamer.</li>
