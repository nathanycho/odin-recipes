    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>I just really like banana pudding. It's kind of an oxymoronic dessert; somehow it's heavy yet light, 
        creamy yet fresh, sweet but not too sweet. It's pretty easy and cheap to make in big batches too! 
        Overall, a 10/10 dessert. I have personally not been to Magnolia before, but I hear their banana pudding 
        is one of the best around.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 (14 oz) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups ice cold water</li>
        <li>1 (3.4 oz) box vanilla instant pudding mix</li>
        <li>3 cups heavy cream</li>
        <li>4 cups sliced barely ripe bananas (see Tips)</li>
        <li>1-2 (12 oz) box Nilla Wafers</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Instructions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, beat together the sweetened condensed milk and water until well combined - about 1 minute. 
            Add the pudding mix and beat well - about 2 minutes. 
            Cover and refrigerate for 3-4 hours or overnight. 
            Note: It's very important to allow the proper amount of time for the pudding mix to set. 
            It will be watery if you don't let it set up long enough.
        </li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whip the heavy cream until stiff peaks form. 
            Gently fold the whipped cream into the pudding mixture until no streaks of pudding remain.
        </li>
        <li>Dessert can either be made in individual portions or in a large glass bowl with 4-5 quart capacity 
            or a 9x13 baking dish.
        </li>
        <li>To assemble dessert, arrange 1/3 of the Nilla wafers covering the bottom, overlapping if necessary. 
            Next, layer 1/3 of the bananas, and 1/3 of the pudding mixture. Repeat twice more, garnishing with additional 
            wafers or wafer crumbs on the top layer. Cover tightly and allow to chill in the fridge for at least 4 hours - 
            or up to 8 hours, no longer!
        </li>

    <h3>Tips</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Pick bananas that are barely ripe. If they are slightly green and the stem, those are perfect. 
                They will not brown as fast.
            </li>
            <li>You can also brush them with some lemon juice.</li>
            <li>You can rinse them with club soda.</li>
            <li>Try to keep the finished dessert airtight.</li>
        </ul>
    </ol>
